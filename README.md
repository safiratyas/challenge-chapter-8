# Binar Car Rental API

## Getting Started 
This repository is an implementation of Binar Car Rental API (Backend) of how the rent car works. Our job is to fix an error or bugs in the code so the swagger can works properly, use an ESLINT to minimize the bugs, make a coverage approximately 70% using JEST, deploy using Heroku, and use Heroku Postgres as database.
